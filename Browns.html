<h2>History</h2>
<br>
<p>The team was founded in 1944 by Arthur McBride. The teams first coach Paul Brown was the best coach they have ever had. When he coached them to 9 championships in the 1950s. They are named after him. In 1995 their owner Art Modell moved the francise to Baltimore and was renamed the ravens. In 2000 they got their francisse back.</p>

<h2>Reason I like the Browns</h2>
<br>
<p>They have been my favorite team for year. I liked them and what ever team Peyton Manning was on. They were the first nfl team I watched and they won that game. They may have not been the greatest team for years but now I have hope.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr class="Browns-hr">
<br>
<br>
<h2>What they are like currently</h2>
<br>
<p>They are poised to have a breakout year this year. I believe they have the talent to make the superbowl this year. That probably won't happen but I have hope. For once browns fans have hope.</p>
